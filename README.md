# EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Multivariate Curve Resolution

üìÑ **ArXiv Preprint:** [EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23600v1)

Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) aims to decompose mixtures of signals into their latent components and concentrations under non-unique and ill-posed settings. Traditional MCR methods typically rely on matrix factorization techniques such as MCR-ALS or NMF, which may struggle when the number of components becomes very large or data sizes are extremely large. Our proposed **EB-gMCR** framework leverages generative deep learning and variational optimization to provide a flexible and scalable solver for challenging large-scale MCR problems.

## üîë Features

* Automatic component selection via differentiable energy-based gating
* Scalable to large pools of candidate spectra (e.g., N‚â´10)
* Supports noisy and large-scale datasets
* Built on PyTorch to leverage GPU acceleration

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b05611038/ebgmcr_solver
cd ebgmcr_solver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ How to Use

You can apply the EB-gMCR solver in just a few lines:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from ebgmcr import RandomComponentMixtureSynthesizer, DenseEBgMCR
>>> data_generator = RandomComponentMixtureSynthesizer(component_number=16,
...                                                    component_dim=512,
...                                                    non_negative_component=True,
...                                                    min_concentration=1.,
...                                                    max_concentration=10.,
...                                                    signal_to_nosie_ratio=20.) # SNR in dB
>>> data = data_generator(64) # 4N dataset
>>> solver = DenseEBgMCR(num_components=1024, dim_components=512, mini_batch_size=16, device = torch.device('cuda:0'))
>>> solver.fit(data, show_eval_info = True, eval_info_display_interval = 100, log_dir = 'outputs')
